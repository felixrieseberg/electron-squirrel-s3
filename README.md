# electron-squirrel-s3
Update your Electron app directly from S3. This module downloads updates for your Electron app from S3; and then creates a fake Squirrel for macOS / OS X update server using Connect. This simplifies your updating on macOS quite dramatically, because you can just use an S3 bucket instead of setting up a whole Squirrel server.
